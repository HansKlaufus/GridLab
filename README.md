# gridLab

Development of a Computer Programme for three-Dimensional Unstructured Grid Generation for Complex Geometries.

## Introduction
gridLab offers three programmes:

* cridLab: This is the command prompt version of the programme.
* gridLab_Linux: This is the Linux version of the programme.
* gridLab_XP: This is the Windows XP version of the programme.

## Starting points
The programme can be compiled using **wxWidgets** and the graphical user interface was created using **wxFormBuilder**, for which the layout is stored in the file 'gridLab.fbp'.

The programme was written using the IDE **Code::Blocks**, which stores each project using the following file types:

* '*.cbp'
* '*.depend'
* '*.layout'

It was compiled using the **Gnu Compiler Collection**.
The folder 'doc/html' contains 'thml'-files created using **doxygen**.
